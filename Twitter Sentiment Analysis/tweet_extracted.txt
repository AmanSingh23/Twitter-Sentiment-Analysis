as an exsoldier i am disgusted but not surprised by distoion of facts relating to field marshal cariappa and general thimayya in election speeches in karnataka. when will faujis soldiers realise how modi has and continues to use them as convenient fools
our govt stands solidly to suppo women at every stage whether they want to become home maker job seeker or job creator  pm modi mahilaparabjpsarkara
 of worlds most polluted cities were in india who no city from karnataka in the list but yes modi ji your constituency varanasi which have bjp mlas bjp mayors amp bjp mps since so many years  is definitely in the list garbage city eh
far from insulting thimayya in or after nehru appointed him as chief of army staff superseding officers senior to him at the time. the pm can ask the raksha mantri to show him the relevant files. 
under pm mudra yojana crore loans have been allocated out of which more than of the beneficiaries are women. they are not only selfemployed but also employing others  pm modi mahilaparabjpsarkara
its amazing how can lie with impunity. none of the media houses seem to concerned 
 is complaining that bollywood has sidelined him after he criticised modi. as if he was amitabh bachchan before that and why the hell he wants to work in hindi movies when he is member of the antinoh india hindi imposition gumpu
modihaters cutting electricity of their own houses to break govts record of electrification  
this is turning out to be quite a mutual admiration club they praise each other amp then the gentlemen protest any suggestion of panership. after a collaborative seat selection the flipflops amp u turns dont confuse the voters. this is a congress vs bjpjds contest. 
can an informed bhakt tell us one just one positive thing that modi has done for us in the last years i ask because the negative stuff he does may have overshadowed some little good he did secretly like feeling sorry for a pup that came under his car tyres for example
